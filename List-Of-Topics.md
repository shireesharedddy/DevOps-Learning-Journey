## Week - 01 - insights
## 1. Linux for DevOps

**Overview**:  
I started my DevOps journey with Linux, as it forms the backbone for many DevOps tools and environments. My focus was on understanding the basics, mastering essential commands, and getting comfortable with the Linux environment.

**Learning Goals**:
- **Navigate the Linux file system and manage permissions**: I began by exploring the Linux file system, learning how to navigate directories, create and edit files, and manage file permissions. Understanding permissions was particularly challenging at first, but practicing with `chmod` and `chown` commands helped me get the hang of it.
  
- **Utilize shell scripting for automation**: Next, I dived into shell scripting. I wrote simple scripts to automate repetitive tasks, like file backups and system monitoring. This was my first introduction to automation, and I found it both exciting and powerful.

- **Understand Linux networking and process management**: I also explored basic networking commands like `ifconfig`, `ping`, and `netstat`, as well as process management tools like `ps`, `top`, and `kill`. These tools are crucial for system administration, and practicing with them gave me a better understanding of how Linux handles processes and networking.

**Challenges & Notes**:
- **Initial Hurdles**: At the start, understanding the syntax of Linux commands was tricky. I often found myself making mistakes, but with consistent practice, my confidence grew.
- **Learning through Practice**: I realized that hands-on practice is essential. I spent time working in a virtual Linux environment, which allowed me to experiment without fear of breaking anything critical. This practical approach has been incredibly beneficial in solidifying my understanding.

Overall, my first week was all about getting comfortable with Linux. I faced challenges, especially with command syntax and understanding permissions, but consistent practice and hands-on exercises helped me overcome them. Iâ€™m excited to build on this foundation as I move forward in my DevOps journey.

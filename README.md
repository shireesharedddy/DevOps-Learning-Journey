# DevOps-Learning-Journey
Documenting my journey as I begin learning DevOps. This repository contains my weekly progress, notes, and hands-on practice with tools like AWS, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines. Iâ€™ll be sharing my experiences, including the challenges and issues I encounter along the way, as I work to build a solid foundation in DevOps concepts.
